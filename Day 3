 so clickjacking is another way of hacking.
# Daily Notes - Introduction to Clickjacking
 A visitor is lured to the evil page. It doesn’t matter how.
The page has a harmless-looking link on it (like “get rich now” or “click here, very funny”).
Over that link the evil page positions a transparent <iframe> with src from facebook.com, in such a way that the “Like” button is right above that link. Usually that’s done with z-index.
In attempting to click the link, the visitor in fact clicks the button.
# Daily Notes - Old school defenses (weak)
 The oldest defense is a bit of JavaScript which forbids opening the page in a frame (so-called “framebusting”).

That looks like this:

if (top != window) {

top.location = window.location;

}

That is: if the window finds out that it’s not on top, then it automatically makes itself the top.

This is not a reliable defense, because there are many ways to hack around it. Let’s cover a few.

# Blocking top-navigation
We can block the transition caused by changing top.location in beforeunload event handler.

The top page (enclosing one, belonging to the hacker) sets a preventing handler to it, like this:

window.onbeforeunload = function() {

return false;

};

When the iframe tries to change top.location, the visitor gets a message asking them whether they want to leave.

In most cases the visitor would answer negatively because they don’t know about the iframe – all they can see is the top page, there’s no reason to leave. So top.location won’t change!
Daily Notes - X-Frame-Options
 The server-side header X-Frame-Options can permit or forbid displaying the page inside a frame.

It must be sent exactly as HTTP-header: the browser will ignore it if found in HTML <meta> tag. So, <meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options"...> won’t do anything.

# The header may have 3 values:

DENY
Never ever show the page inside a frame.

SAMEORIGIN
Allow inside a frame if the parent document comes from the same origin.

ALLOW-FROM domain
Allow inside a frame if the parent document is from the given domain.

For instance, Twitter uses X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN.

Here’s the result:

<iframe src="https://twitter.com"></iframe>

Depending on your browser, the iframe above is either empty or alerting you that the browser won’t permit that page to be navigating in this way.

Showing with disabled functionality
The X-Frame-Options header has a side-effect. Other sites won’t be able to show our page in a frame, even if they have good reasons to do so.

So there are other solutions… For instance, we can “cover” the page with a <div> with styles height: 100%; width: 100%;, so that it will intercept all clicks. That <div> is to be removed if window == top or if we figure out that we don’t need the protection.
Daily Notes - Samesite cookie attribute
 "When Facebook is open in an iframe from another site, such a cookie wouldn’t be sent, so the attack would fail."
the statement suggests that there is a protective measure in place to safeguard against certain cookie-based attacks when Facebook is loaded within an iframe on a different website. This measure restricts the accessibility of Facebook's cookies in this specific context, making it harder for attackers to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
# Daily Notes - Activity 1 - Clickjacking presentation
 motives behind Clickjacking:
Stealing sensitive information.
Forcing users to like/share a page on social media.
Initiating financial transactions without user consent.
Distributing malware or phishing attacks.
The methods used by attackers:
Transparency: Overlaying malicious content on top of legitimate content.
Frames: Embedding a target site within an invisible frame.
Opacity: Making the malicious elements transparent.
CSS Styling: Manipulating CSS to make elements invisible.
Social Engineering: Trick users into clicking on something deceptive.
an example of Clickjacking:
A user thinks they are clicking on a harmless image or button (e.g., "Like" button) but is actually liking a malicious page.
Show a screenshot of the deceptive page.
Detection and Prevention
how to detect and prevent Clickjacking:
X-Frame-Options header.
Content Security Policy (CSP).
Frame-busting scripts.
User education and awareness.
